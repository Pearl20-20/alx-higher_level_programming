Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique used in software development to bridge the gap between relational databases and object-oriented programming languages like Python. ORM allows developers to interact with databases using object-oriented principles, making it easier to manage and manipulate data.

In Python, there are several popular ORM libraries that facilitate this process. Some of the most widely used ones are:

SQLAlchemy: SQLAlchemy is a powerful and flexible ORM that provides a high-level API for working with databases. It supports a variety of database backends and offers both high-level and low-level query APIs. SQLAlchemy also has an Object-Relational Query Language (ORMQL) for querying and manipulating data.
