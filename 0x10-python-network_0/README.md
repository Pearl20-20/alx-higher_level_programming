Python provides several libraries and modules to work with networking, allowing you to create client-server applications, handle sockets, send and receive data over the internet, and more. Some of the commonly used modules for networking in Python are:

Socket: The socket module is the foundation of all networking in Python. It provides low-level access to network communication and allows you to create sockets (endpoints for communication) for various network protocols, such as TCP and UDP.

Requests: The requests library is widely used for making HTTP requests and interacting with web services. It simplifies sending HTTP requests and handling responses.

HTTP Server: Python provides an HTTP server module that allows you to create a simple web server. It can be used to serve static files or handle dynamic content.

SocketServer: This module builds on top of the socket module and provides a framework for creating network servers, including TCP servers and UDP servers.

Asyncio: The asyncio library provides support for asynchronous programming, allowing you to create asynchronous network applications that can handle multiple connections efficiently.

Here's a basic example of a simple TCP server using the socket module:

pytho
import socket

def main():
    # Create a TCP/IP socket
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    # Bind the socket to a specific address and port
    server_address = ('localhost', 12345)
    server_socket.bind(server_address)

    # Listen for incoming connections (max 1 pending connection)
    server_socket.listen(1)

    print("Server is listening on {}:{}".format(*server_address))

    while True:
        # Wait for a connection
        connection, client_address = server_socket.accept()

        try:
            print("Connection from {}:{}".format(*client_address))

            # Receive data from the client
            data = connection.recv(1024)
            if data:
                print("Received: {}".format(data.decode('utf-8')))
            else:
                print("No more data from {}:{}".format(*client_address))
                break

        finally:
            

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
Save to grepper
You can run this server and connect to it using a client program (e.g., using telnet on the terminal) to see how the server handles incoming connections and data.

Remember that network programming involves error handling, security considerations, and other complexities. Always take proper precautions when building real-world networked applications.
